It's always wonderful to discuss and share ideas and perspectives. One of my fellow HCI researchers, Md. Zarif Kaisar and I just had an excellent discussion about the book "Show Your Work" by Austin Kleon. This session made me realize how important it is to find my SCENIUS and KNUCKLEBALLER!

I highly recommend this book, regardless of your profession. If you do not have the time to read, let me know if you prefer a Medium article or a half-hour-long podcast-like video where we summarize the book. We have a lot to share about the book and our experiences. üôåüèΩ
Let us know!
