Apple is cooking something awesome! I always say Apple is more of a design company. Though they sometimes go for form over usability, they never miss the chance to make their products more accessible and inclusive.

Appleâ€™s new iOS features (coming later this year):

**Assistive Access:** Simplifies apps for users with cognitive disabilities, focusing on essential features like communication, photos, and music.



**Live Speech:** Allows users to type and have their words spoken aloud during calls and conversations.



**Personal Voice:** This is my favorite! It enables users at risk of losing their ability to speak to create a personalized synthesized voice. Personal Voice is a feature that allows users who are at risk of losing their ability to speak to create a voice that sounds like them. It involves recording 15 minutes of audio on an iPhone or iPad using randomized text prompts. The feature uses on-device machine learning to ensure privacy and security. It seamlessly integrates with Live Speech, allowing users to speak with their Personal Voice when connecting with loved ones. This capability is especially valuable for individuals with conditions like ALS.



**Point and Speak in Magnifier:** Helps users with vision disabilities interact with physical objects by identifying and reading text aloud.

**Additional Features:** Improved accessibility for hearing, motor, and vision impairments, including phonetic suggestions, game controller options, and more.
