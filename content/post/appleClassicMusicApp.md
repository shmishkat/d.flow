Apple silently bought a classical music streaming service, Primephonic, and killed it to launch its own. Apple did it to solve a UX problemâ€”searching classical music by its convoluted names.

Classical music's naming conventions are not as simple as those of modern genres like pop, rock, indie, etc. The titles of classical music include a lot of information, so searching for and finding the desired piece gets tricky.

I wrote an article on how Apple solved this UX problem, which got published on UX Collective. Let me know what you think!
