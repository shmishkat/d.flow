### Design Flows ###
The inspiration behind this website was the book [Show Your Work by Austin Kleon](https://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Austin-Kleon/dp/076117897X). In the third chapter, “Share something small every day,” the author discussed the concept of “Flow and stock.” 

Flow is basically the stream of updates of what I’m reading, practicing, and working on daily. On the other hand, Stock is something that is relevant today or in two years, such as my case studies, articles, artifacts, etc. Which are suitable for my [portfolio](https://www.sarowarhossain.com/).

The idea I liked the most was that the author discussed social media sites work like public notebooks, where we can think out loud, and it allows other people to THINK BACK. Over time, the flow helps us think clearly, build patterns, and form Stock over time. 

**So why this site?** <br/>
I strongly agree with the fact that today’s no. 1 social media platform might not exist tomorrow. LinkedIn might not be the best platform in the future. But if I own a domain and build my site on the internet, it will stay with me forever. More importantly, I can shape it however I like. <br/>
***This was how this site was born.***
